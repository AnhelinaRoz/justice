                    particularly for marginalized groups. We support training emphasizing human rights and community
                    engagement, and we challenge unlawful practices through litigation. By collaborating widely, we seek
                    to transform law enforcement attitudes towards respecting human rights, believing in the power of
                    reform for social change.</p>

                <p class="p">"Justice for All International" is actively engaged in advocating for high-profile cases
                    involving significant human rights violations. Currently, our petitions focus on addressing the
                    unjust treatment and arbitrary detention of individuals such as Julian Assange and Craig Murray.</p>
                <p class="p">Our petition for Julian Assange emphasizes the ongoing injustice of his nearly 14-year-long
                    arbitrary detention by the UK. We call for his immediate release and urge the United Nations High
                    Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Procedures mandate holders to address his case with the
                    urgency it deserves.</p>
                <p class="p">This petition also highlights the misleading assurances provided by the U.S. regarding
                    First Amendment protections, casting doubt on the fairness of Assange's potential extradition to the
                    United States.</p>
                <p class="p">Regarding Craig Murray, our petition brings attention to his prosecution under the UK
                    Terrorism Act 2000, particularly for his peaceful support of the Palestinian people's right to
                    self-defense. His case has experienced a lack of decisive action and attention from the OHCHR,
                    despite repeated appeals and submissions. We seek to highlight the broader implications of his case
                    for freedom of speech and the protection of human rights defenders.</p>
