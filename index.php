                                addressing the
                                unjust treatment and arbitrary detention of individuals such as Julian Assange and
                                Craig Murray.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p">Our petition for Julian Assange emphasizes the ongoing injustice of his
                                nearly
                                14-year-long
                                arbitrary detention by the UK. We call for his immediate release and urge the United
                                Nations
                                High
                                Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Procedures mandate holders to address his
                                case with
                                the
                                urgency it deserves.</p>
                            <p class="p">This petition also highlights the misleading assurances provided by the
                                U.S. regarding
                                First Amendment protections, casting doubt on the fairness of Assange's potential
                                extradition to
                                the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p class="p">Regarding Craig Murray, our petition brings attention to his prosecution
                                under the UK
                                Terrorism Act 2000, particularly for his peaceful support of the Palestinian
                                people's right to
                                self-defense. His case has experienced a lack of decisive action and attention from
                                the OHCHR,
                                despite repeated appeals and submissions. We seek to highlight the broader
                                implications of his
                                case
                                for freedom of speech and the protection of human rights defenders.</p>

                            <p class="p">"Justice for All International" is proud to highlight a significant achievement in our ongoing commitment to defending human rights and the rule of law. We recently submitted a crucial case to the United Nations Special Procedures, focusing on the impact of international sanctions on entrepreneurial freedomâa topic seldom addressed in human rights discourse.</p>
                            <p class="p"> Our submission revolved around the case of Ms. Alena Bekker, a German entrepreneur whose business faced severe legal repercussions due to the EU's sanctions regime. Ms. Bekker's company, Texforum-Interhandel e.K., attempted to import linen briquettes from Belarus, which were wrongly reclassified as wood products under EU sanctions, leading to unwarranted criminal charges. This case highlighted the excessive compliance and arbitrary enforcement by authorities, which not only stifled entrepreneurial activity but also infringed on basic human rights, including the right to a fair trial and equality before the law.</p>
                            <p class="p">Through our advocacy, this case has brought to light the broader implications of sanctions on small and medium-sized enterprises and the need for a more principled approach that respects human rights and the rule of law in global trade practices. We continue to stand with Ms. Bekker and advocate for fair legal treatment and economic policies that safeguard the rights of all entrepreneurs.</p>
